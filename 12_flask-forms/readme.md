### DISCOS:
- response = request.form.get('username') in app.py and {{username}} in response.html to get inputted username
- method = request.method and {{method}} in response.html to get method used
- GET displays all the info in the webpage in the URL
- query strings (POST method)+ request.args.get() prevents app from failing

### QCC:
- When is it better to use GET than POST?
