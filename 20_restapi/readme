## DISCO
- to open the url in flask, import urllib.request then use 
    ```
    urllib.request.open(url)
    ```
    - data is a string or a Request Object
- read json file from document
    ```
    json.load(var)
    ```
## QCC
- While browsing the interTrash I came across 'import jsonify', what is that?
- Also what's the difference between json.load() and json.loads()? 
    - I searched it up and one says 'json.load' is to read json file from document while 'json.loads()' is to convert that into a python dictionary.
