DISCO:
- The documentation for foundation is very similarly layed out as bootstrap but one of the good thing is that in the docs, foundation has a badge next to each component denoting if it contains JS 
- button colors and callouts naming very similar to bootstrap 
- cool quotation citations and implementation of it

QCC:
- We noticed that there was a button rounded in the source code but when it rendered, nothing happened. Is there any reason why?
- What's overflow-hidden attribute?

q0: 1
- We spoke with our neighboring duo and they said they wanted to also add card to their foundation but couldn't get it to work so we decided to check it our for fun
    - https://get.foundation/sites/docs/card.html  

q1: 
- Bootstrap because this there are more specifics in naming such as card-header, card-body whereas foundation just has card-section and a divider
