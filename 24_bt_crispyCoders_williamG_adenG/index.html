                        <p> In a galaxy far far away....
                            <br/>  
                            Just kidding. Thor was high in the tree tops when he found a barrel sitting atop his tree. On the barrel 
                            were straps and a huge red sign that read <span class = "badge alert"> <strong>DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME</strong> </span>. 
                            Obviously being the highly intelligent duckie Thor was, he moved away from his own treetop to another one 
                            so now he can try on this barrel since he's not home anymore. He glided for around 20 feet before the barrel
                            exploded landing him on a tree. Thor was unconcious and recovered in time to see Steve's back as he trotted 
                            into the forest.

                        <p>One day in an uneventuful forest, Steve was out collecting firewood when a explosion rang out from the distance.
                            He ran towards the sound (after going home first to eat his breakfast first of course) and found some random monkey 
                            with a barrel. Steve bark at him quite some time but not response was given. He tried throwing his firewood and knocking 
                            Thor down but because he was too short, the firewood ended up hitting Steve's head. He gave up after 3 attempts before barking 
                            at Thor for being idiotic and heading back home to sleep.
